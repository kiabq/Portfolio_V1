Welcome to my site, I'm Joseph. I work full-time as a Software Engineer and I'm also a Computer Science student. I have two cats, CiCi and Raven, and I live in North Carolina.    
<br>
Outside of programming and studying, I enjoy trying new things. I'm into computers (that's not programming, right?), fashion, cars, and motorcycles. Staying active is a big part of my life, and I believe in a "strong body, strong mind" philosophy. I'm often at the climbing gym solving indoor boulder problems, training calisthenics, or doing something a little more daring--like that one time I went skydiving (I highly recommend btw).
